This meme generator will allow you to generate png or jpg 
image from HTML content. This content can be anything you
 want. For this project, it will be a single image and two
  headings, positioned absolutely on the image. The first
   heading will be at the top of the image and the second 
   will be at the bottom.

You will be able to add the image in two ways. First, the 
meme generator will fetch random image from api.imgflip.com.
 Donâ€™t worry, no token or registration required. Second, you
  will be able to open image from your disk, using file input.
   To generate the png or jpg file this meme generator will
    use dom-to-image-more package.
